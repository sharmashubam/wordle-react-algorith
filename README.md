The game logic is built using JavaScript. It works by randomly selecting a word from a pre-defined list of words and then displaying it as a set of dashes, representing each letter of the word. The player must then guess the word by inputting letters. For each correct letter, the corresponding dash will be replaced with the letter. If the player correctly guesses the word, they win the game. Incorrect guesses will be recorded and displayed to the player.
